frontend changes: ~~markthrough means completed~~
pagnation:

- change row selector to Fill (show rows to bottom of screen, no scroll) or All (show all results, scroll is fine)

table changes:

- cell size should be fit to largest entry instead of current dynamic state (abrivate col names if needed)
- remove comma from year joined, last DOS, and shred year entries.
- revamp row highlighting:
  - red: no match (defualt if no OCR response or .5 or lower confidence)
  - Orange: itermediate match (.5-.75)
  - Green: best or perfect match (.76-.999~)

Control Panel:

- new button layout should be as follows:
  boxNum text input, getBox button, image input button, send image, divider, undo, undo all, divider, submit to sheet, view image (hugs right wall)

Bugs:

- last row gets cut off (bug, adding padding-bottom)
- investigate send image button invokes Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')

Features:

- ensure rows from tables are inline with eachother for ease of mapping
- move picture to collapsleable pop out.
  Description:
  availble via view picture button.
  should display picture with similar background style as current iteration, along with three icons in the top right of the image.
  pop up should first appear on the hugging the right wall and displaying the full image.
  Thumtack icon will pin image to whichever side its closest to

  components:

  - thumtack icon (pin to side bar icon)
  - click and drag icon (move pop up around)
  - zoom icon (investigate differtent zoom designs (static one-time or dynamic zoom?))

  Side Bar Styling:

  - image fits in container without horizontal scroll
  - should fill screen vertically
  - vertical scroll is fine
  - 6px padding-left, right, and bottom
  - padding-top is your choice, perferably remaining numericaly consisitent with table
