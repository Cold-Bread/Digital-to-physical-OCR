Excel columns top->Down, Left->Right
I need to pull a set of rows based on the box ID (given) into a interal database to run comparisons off of to then update info if needed

chart  (this is box number, use to_upper on api payload for consistency)
Patient Name: String
DOB: String
Year Joined: Int
Last DOS: Int
Shred Year: Int
IsChildWhenJoined: Int


** I need to pull data from the excel sheet based on which box were using
database.py - only if we are adding things to the excel sheet, (a internal database)


jordan runs 1 wrapper function that returns a tuple of the results of each ocr's true results (run through fuzzy search as well)

** Need to add macro in excel to auto check the boxes




order of api calls:
- On webapp type in box number, push sendBOXID
--> Backend runs a sql query for relevant rows in excel 
--> Takes rows, store in database.DOB

- Frontend send a image that has file names/dob's
--> Run image through all OCRs
--> Do processes that increase cofindence in results
--> Package list of names, with DOB's and return to frontend

- User edits possible errors, pushes submitTABLE
--> backend gets object, and puts into datbase.db (already formated correctly)

example: 
def function{
    OCRResult response1 = await ocr1()
    OCRResult response2 = await ocr2()

    return response1, response2
}

... (Do processes that increase cofindence in results)

def finalOCRResult{
    Package list of names, with DOB's and send to jordan
}

Can you edit the backend2 folder to follow the list of api calls specified in plan.txt

Edit backendResponse.txt to have the new interface objects
